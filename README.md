The Abyssal Hyperplane 

Preface / Concept:

Capturing the architecture in a model improves the depth and quality of baseline products due to the fact that, unlike the spreadsheets it replaced, the model inherently captures relationships between elements. Using the model, one can drill down and explore various aspects of the architecture, e.g., a) the network design that supports data exchanges; b) component systems that use a particular network Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN); c) service level requirements levied upon data providers.
